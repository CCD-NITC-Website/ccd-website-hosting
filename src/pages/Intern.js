            During the summer vacation (Mid May to Mid July). Some of the internship offers lead to the Pre-placement offer (PPO), depending upon the performance of the students during the internship period. The students have the right to reject/accept the PPO at the end of the internship period. If the student accepts the PPO from a firm, the student will be ‘placed’ in that firm and will not be permitted to attend the placement campaign in their final year. If the student rejects the PPO and informs the CCD team, within the deadline provided by the CCD, the student will be allowed to participate in the placement campaign.
